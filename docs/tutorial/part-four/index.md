Welcome to Part Four of the tutorial! Halfway through! Hope things are starting
to feel pretty comfortable ðŸ˜€

## Recap of first half of the tutorial

So far, you've been learning how to use React.jsâ€”how powerful it is to be able to
create your _own_ components to act as custom building blocks for websites.

Youâ€™ve also explored styling components using CSS Modules.

## What's in this tutorial?

In the next four parts of the tutorial (including this one), you'll be diving into the Gatsby data layer, which is a powerful feature of Gatsby that lets you easily build sites from Markdown, WordPress, headless CMSs, and other data sources of all flavors.

**NOTE:** Gatsbyâ€™s data layer is powered by GraphQL. For an in-depth tutorial on
GraphQL, we recommend [How to GraphQL](https://www.howtographql.com/).

## Data in Gatsby

A website has four parts, HTML, CSS, JS, and data. The first half of the
tutorial focused on the first three. Let's learn now how to use data in Gatsby
sites.

What is data?

A very computer science-y answer would be: data is things like `"strings"`,
integers (`42`), objects (`{ pizza: true }`), etc.

For the purpose of working in Gatsby, however, a more useful answer is
"everything that lives outside a React component".

So far, you've been writing text and adding images _directly_ in components.
Which is an _excellent_ way to build many websites. But, often you want to store
data _outside_ components and then bring the data _into_ the component as
needed.

For example, if you're building a site with WordPress (so other contributors
have a nice interface for adding & maintaining content) and Gatsby, the _data_
for the site (pages and posts) are in WordPress and you _pull_ that data, as
needed, into your components.

Data can also live in file types like Markdown, CSV, etc. as well as databases
and APIs of all sorts.

**Gatsby's data layer lets you pull data from these (and any other source)
directly into your components**â€”in the shape and form you want.

## How Gatsby's data layer uses GraphQL to pull data into components

There are many options for loading data into React components. One of the most
popular and powerful of these is a technology called
[GraphQL](http://graphql.org/).

GraphQL was invented at Facebook to help product engineers _pull_ needed data into
components.

GraphQL is a **q**uery **l**anguage (the _QL_ part of its name). If you're
familiar with SQL, it works in a very similar way. Using a special syntax, you describe
the data you want in your component and then that data is given
to you.

Gatsby uses GraphQL to enable components to declare the data they need.

## Your first GraphQL query

Let's create another new site for this part of the tutorial like in the previous
parts. You're going to build a Markdown blog called "Pandas Eating Lots".
It's dedicated to showing off the best pictures & videos of Pandas eating lots
of food. Along the way you'll be dipping your toes into GraphQL and Gatsby's
Markdown support.

Open a new terminal window and run the following commands to create a new Gatsby site in a directory called `tutorial-part-four`. Then change to this new directory:

```shell
gatsby new tutorial-part-four https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world#v2
cd tutorial-part-four
```

Then install some other needed dependencies at the root of the project. You'll use the Typography theme
Kirkham + you'll try out a CSS-in-JS library
[Emotion](https://emotion.sh/):

```shell
npm install --save gatsby-plugin-typography typography react-typography typography-theme-kirkham
gatsby-plugin-emotion emotion react-emotion emotion-server
```

Let's set up a site similar to what you ended with in Part Three. This site will have a layout
component and two page components:

`src/components/layout.js`

```jsx
import React from "react"
import { css } from "react-emotion"
import { Link } from "gatsby"

import { rhythm } from "../utils/typography"

export default ({ children }) => (
  <div
    className={css`
      margin: 0 auto;
      max-width: 700px;
      padding: ${rhythm(2)};
      padding-top: ${rhythm(1.5)};
    `}
  >
    <Link to={`/`}>
      <h3
        className={css`
          margin-bottom: ${rhythm(2)};
          display: inline-block;
          font-style: normal;
        `}
      >
        Pandas Eating Lots
      </h3>
    </Link>
    <Link
      to={`/about/`}
      className={css`
        float: right;
      `}
    >
      About
    </Link>
    {children}
  </div>
)
```

`src/pages/index.js`

```jsx
import React from "react"
import Layout from "../components/layout"

export default () => (
  <Layout>
    <h1>Amazing Pandas Eating Things</h1>
    <div>
      <img
        src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BMP2l6Hwvp4/TiAxeGx4CTI/AAAAAAAAD_M/XlC_mY3SoEw/s1600/panda-group-eating-bamboo.jpg"
        alt="Group of pandas eating bamboo"
      />
    </div>
  </Layout>
)
```

`src/pages/about.js`

```jsx
import React from "react"
import Layout from "../components/layout"

export default () => (
  <Layout>
    <h1>About Pandas Eating Lots</h1>
    <p>
      We're the only site running on your computer dedicated to showing the best
      photos and videos of pandas eating lots of food.
    </p>
  </Layout>
)
```

`src/utils/typography.js`

```javascript
import Typography from "typography"
import kirkhamTheme from "typography-theme-kirkham"

const typography = new Typography(kirkhamTheme)

export default typography
export const rhythm = typography.rhythm
```

`gatsby-config.js` (must be in the root of your project, not under src)

```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    `gatsby-plugin-emotion`,
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-typography`,
      options: {
        pathToConfigModule: `src/utils/typography`,
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

Add the above files and then run `gatsby develop` like normal and you should see
the following:

![start](start.png)

You have another small site with a layout and two pages.

Now let's start querying ðŸ˜‹

## Querying for the site title

When building sites, it's common to want to reuse common bits of data across the
site. Like the _site title_ for example. Look at the `/about/` page. You'll
notice that you have the site title in both the layout component (the site
header) as well as in the title of the About page. But what if you want to change
the site title at some point in the future? You'd have to search across all your
components for spots using the site title and edit each instance of the title. This process is both cumbersome and
error-prone, especially as sites get larger and more complex. It's much better to
store the title in one place and then _pull_ that title into components whenever
you need it.

To solve this, you can add site "metadata" â€” like page title or description â€” to the `gatsby-config.js` file. Let's add your site title to
`gatsby-config.js` file and then query it from your layout and about page!

Edit your `gatsby-config.js`:

```javascript{2-4}
module.exports = {
  siteMetadata: {
    title: `Blah Blah Fake Title`,
  },
  plugins: [
    `gatsby-plugin-emotion`,
    {
      resolve: `gatsby-plugin-typography`,
      options: {
        pathToConfigModule: `src/utils/typography`,
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

Restart the development server.

Then edit the two components:

`src/pages/about.js`

```jsx{2,5,7,14-23}
import React from "react"
import { graphql } from "gatsby"
import Layout from "../components/layout"

export default ({ data }) => (
  <Layout>
    <h1>About {data.site.siteMetadata.title}</h1>
    <p>
      We're the only site running on your computer dedicated to showing the best
      photos and videos of pandas eating lots of food.
    </p>
  </Layout>
)

export const query = graphql`
  query AboutQuery {
    site {
      siteMetadata {
        title
      }
    }
  }
`
```

`src/components/layout.js`

```jsx{3,8-18,35}
import React from "react"
import { css } from "react-emotion"
import { StaticQuery, Link, graphql } from "gatsby"

import { rhythm } from "../utils/typography"

export default ({ children }) => (
  <StaticQuery
    query={graphql`
      query LayoutQuery {
        site {
          siteMetadata {
            title
          }
        }
      }
    `}
    render={data => (
      <div
        className={css`
          margin: 0 auto;
          max-width: 700px;
          padding: ${rhythm(2)};
          padding-top: ${rhythm(1.5)};
        `}
      >
        <Link to={`/`}>
          <h3
            className={css`
              margin-bottom: ${rhythm(2)};
              display: inline-block;
              font-style: normal;
            `}
          >
            {data.site.siteMetadata.title}
          </h3>
        </Link>
        <Link
          to={`/about/`}
          className={css`
            float: right;
          `}
        >
          About
        </Link>
        {children}
      </div>
    )}
  />
)
```

It worked!! ðŸŽ‰

![fake-title-graphql](fake-title-graphql.png)

But let's restore the real title.

One of the core principles of Gatsby is _creators need an immediate connection to
what they're creating_
([hat tip to Bret Victor](http://blog.ezyang.com/2012/02/transcript-of-inventing-on-principleb/)).
Or, in other words, when you make any change to code you should immediately see
the effect of that change. You manipulate an input of Gatsby and you see the new
output showing up on the screen.

So almost everywhere, changes you make will immediately take effect.

Try editing the title in `siteMetadata`â€”change the title back to "Pandas Eating
Lots". The change should show up very quickly in your browser.

## How does the graphql tag work?

You may have noticed that you used a [tag function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#Tagged_template_literals) called `graphql`. Behind the scenes Gatsby handles these tags in a particular way - let's explore what actually happens when you use Gatsby's `graphql` tag:

The short answer is this: during the Gatsby build process, GraphQL queries are pulled out of the original source for parsing.

The longer answer is a little more involved: Gatsby borrows a technique from
[Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/) that converts your source code into an [abstract syntax tree (AST)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) during the build step. [`file-parser.js`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/master/packages/gatsby/src/internal-plugins/query-runner/file-parser.js) and [`query-compiler.js`](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/master/packages/gatsby/src/internal-plugins/query-runner/query-compiler.js) pick out your `graphql`-tagged templates and effectively remove them from the original source code.

This means that the `graphql` tag isnâ€™t executed the way that you might expect. For example, you cannot use [expression interpolation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#Expression_interpolation) with Gatsby's `graphql` tag.

## What's coming next?

Next, you'll be learning about how to pull data into your Gatsby site using GraphQL with source plugins in [part five](/tutorial/part-five/) of the tutorial.
